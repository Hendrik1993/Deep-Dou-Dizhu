# UNO-RL
Deep Reinforcement Learning Semester Project @ UOS


## Info
If you want to track your training progress with your own COMET.ml account, create a file called ``.env``
and add your comet.ml credentials like that (change the names according to your settings):

```
export COMET_API_KEY="aföisukbföqwrfberkj"
export COMET_PROJECT_NAME="uno-rl"
export COMET_WORKSPACE="johndoe"
```
